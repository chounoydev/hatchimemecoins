      <p className="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-lg font-modern">
       hatchi was a real dog, but he passed away on january 3, 2026, just after the new year. 
       he suddenly became weak and slowly lost his appetite. hatchi was a chow chow and only two years old,
        which makes his passing even more heartbreaking. he was one of our most beloved dogs,
         and losing him has been incredibly hard for us to accept. because of the pain and love we have for him,
          we decided to create a new memecoin inspired by our dog hatchi, who is no longer with us and has gone to heaven.
           he became our inspiration, and through this project, we want his memory to live on.
            hatchi is more than just a dog to us—he is the heart behind what we believe will be the next memecoin to trend.
